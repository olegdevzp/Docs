## Node.js Fundamentals

### Basic Concepts

#### 1. What is Node.js and how does it differ from browser JavaScript?

**Answer:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. Key differences from browser JavaScript:

- **Environment**: Node.js runs on servers/computers, while browser JavaScript runs in web browsers
- **APIs**: Node.js has file system access, network capabilities, and OS interaction APIs that browsers don't have for security reasons
- **Global Object**: Node.js uses `global` object instead of `window`
- **Modules**: Node.js uses CommonJS modules (`require()`/`module.exports`) while browsers traditionally used script tags (now also support ES modules)
- **Event Loop**: Both have event loops, but Node.js can handle server operations like file I/O and network requests

- [Node.js vs Browser JavaScript](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/differences-between-nodejs-and-the-browser/)

#### 2. What is the V8 engine and how does Node.js use it?

**Answer:** V8 is Google's open-source JavaScript engine written in C++ that compiles JavaScript to machine code. Node.js uses V8 to:

- **Parse and Execute**: V8 parses JavaScript code and compiles it to optimized machine code
- **Memory Management**: Handles garbage collection and memory allocation
- **Performance**: Provides just-in-time (JIT) compilation for fast execution
- **C++ Integration**: Allows Node.js to expose C++ functionality to JavaScript through bindings

Node.js extends V8 with additional APIs for file system, networking, and other server-side operations.

- [How Node.js Works - V8 Engine](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-v8-javascript-engine/)

#### 3. What is the event loop in Node.js and how does it work?

**Answer:** The event loop is the core mechanism that makes Node.js non-blocking and asynchronous. It works in phases:

1. **Timer Phase**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`
2. **Pending Callbacks**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration
3. **Idle, Prepare**: Internal use only
4. **Poll Phase**: Fetches new I/O events and executes I/O callbacks
5. **Check Phase**: Executes `setImmediate()` callbacks
6. **Close Callbacks**: Executes close event callbacks

The event loop continuously cycles through these phases, processing callbacks and maintaining the non-blocking nature of Node.js.

- [Node.js Event Loop Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/)
- [Understanding the Event Loop](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-nodejs-event-loop/)

#### 4. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of Node.js?

**Answer:**

**Advantages:**
- **Fast Performance**: V8 engine and non-blocking I/O
- **Single Language**: JavaScript for both frontend and backend
- **Large Ecosystem**: Extensive npm package repository
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture handles many concurrent connections
- **Real-time Applications**: Excellent for chat apps, gaming, collaboration tools
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON handling
- **Active Community**: Large, active developer community

**Disadvantages:**
- **Single-threaded**: CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop
- **Callback Complexity**: Can lead to callback hell (though Promises/async-await help)
- **Rapid Changes**: Fast-paced development can lead to instability
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume more memory than traditional servers
- **Not Suitable for Heavy Computing**: Poor choice for CPU-intensive applications

**Links:**

- [When to Use Node.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/when-to-use-node-js/)

#### 5. What is non-blocking I/O and why is it important in Node.js?

**Answer:** Non-blocking I/O means that I/O operations (file reads, database queries, network requests) don't halt the execution of other code. Instead of waiting for an operation to complete:

- **Asynchronous Execution**: The operation starts and a callback is registered
- **Event Loop Continues**: Other code continues executing
- **Callback Execution**: When the operation completes, its callback is executed

**Importance:**
- **High Concurrency**: Can handle thousands of concurrent connections
- **Better Performance**: No threads blocked waiting for I/O
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower memory footprint compared to thread-per-request models
- **Scalability**: Scales well with increasing load

**Links:**
- [Blocking vs Non-Blocking Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/)
- [Understanding Non-Blocking I/O](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/nodejs-asynchronous-flow-control/)

#### 6. What is the difference between Node.js and other server-side technologies like PHP or Python?

**Answer:**

**Node.js vs PHP:**
- **Language**: JavaScript vs PHP
- **Execution**: Event-driven, non-blocking vs traditionally synchronous
- **Performance**: Generally faster for I/O operations
- **Learning Curve**: Easier if you know JavaScript

**Node.js vs Python:**
- **Concurrency**: Event loop vs threading/multiprocessing
- **Performance**: Faster for I/O-bound tasks, Python better for CPU-bound
- **Ecosystem**: npm vs pip package managers
- **Use Cases**: Node.js better for real-time apps, Python better for data science/ML

**Node.js vs Java:**
- **Threading Model**: Single-threaded event loop vs multi-threaded
- **Memory Usage**: Generally lower memory footprint
- **Development Speed**: Faster development cycle
- **Enterprise Features**: Java has more mature enterprise tools

- [Node.js vs Python](https://www.simform.com/blog/nodejs-vs-python/)

#### 7. What is the global object in Node.js?

**Answer:** The global object in Node.js is `global`, which serves as the global namespace (similar to `window` in browsers). Key properties include:

- **`global`**: Reference to the global object itself
- **`process`**: Information about the current Node.js process
- **`Buffer`**: Global class for handling binary data
- **`console`**: Console logging functionality
- **`setTimeout/setInterval`**: Timer functions
- **`setImmediate/clearImmediate`**: Immediate execution functions
- **`__dirname`**: Directory name of current module
- **`__filename`**: File name of current module
- **`require`**: Function to import modules
- **`module`**: Reference to current module
- **`exports`**: Shortcut to module.exports

**Links:**
- [Node.js Global Objects](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html)
- [Understanding Global Object](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/nodejs-global-objects/)

#### 8. What are Buffer objects and when would you use them?

**Answer:** Buffer is a global class for handling binary data in Node.js. Since JavaScript traditionally only handled strings and numbers, Buffer provides a way to work with raw binary data.

**Use Cases:**
- **File Operations**: Reading/writing binary files (images, videos, executables)
- **Network Communication**: Handling TCP streams, HTTP request bodies
- **Cryptography**: Working with encrypted data
- **Data Processing**: Converting between different encodings (UTF-8, Base64, hex)

**Common Methods:**
```javascript
// Creating buffers
Buffer.from('hello', 'utf8')
Buffer.alloc(10) // Creates 10-byte buffer filled with zeros
Buffer.allocUnsafe(10) // Faster but may contain old data

// Working with buffers
buffer.toString('utf8')
buffer.write('hello')
buffer.slice(0, 5)
```

**Links:**
- [Node.js Buffer Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)
- [Understanding Buffers](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/nodejs-buffers/)

#### 9. What is the process object in Node.js?

**Answer:** The `process` object is a global object that provides information about and control over the current Node.js process. Key properties and methods:

**Properties:**
- **`process.argv`**: Command line arguments
- **`process.env`**: Environment variables
- **`process.pid`**: Process ID
- **`process.platform`**: Operating system platform
- **`process.version`**: Node.js version
- **`process.cwd()`**: Current working directory

**Methods:**
- **`process.exit()`**: Exit the process
- **`process.nextTick()`**: Schedule callback for next event loop iteration
- **`process.chdir()`**: Change working directory

**Events:**
- **`exit`**: Process is about to exit
- **`uncaughtException`**: Unhandled exception occurred
- **`unhandledRejection`**: Promise rejection not handled

**Links:**
- [Node.js Process Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html)
- [Understanding Process Object](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/nodejs-process-object/)

#### 10. What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?

**Answer:** Environment variables are key-value pairs stored in the operating system that provide configuration information to applications. They're useful for:

**Use Cases:**
- **Configuration**: Database URLs, API keys, port numbers
- **Environment Detection**: Development, staging, production
- **Security**: Storing sensitive information outside code
- **Deployment**: Different settings for different environments

**Accessing in Node.js:**
```javascript
// Reading environment variables
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const nodeEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

// Setting environment variables (programmatically)
process.env.MY_VARIABLE = 'some value';
```

**Setting Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Command line (Unix/Linux/Mac)
export PORT=3000
node app.js

# Command line (Windows)
set PORT=3000
node app.js

# .env file (with dotenv package)
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
```
