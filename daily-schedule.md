## Tips for Success

### Energy Management & Flow
- **Morning Routine (9:00-9:30):** Start fresh with shower and breakfast
- **Morning Learning (9:30-12:40):** Peak cognitive performance with regular breaks every 30-60 min
- **Midday Active (12:40-14:50):** Physical activities reset your energy for afternoon
- **Afternoon Work (15:30-20:00):** Deep work split into manageable 90-min chunks
- **Evening Creative (20:15-21:15):** Guitar practice to wind down naturally

### Break Philosophy
- **10-min breaks:** Quick reset - stretch, hydrate, walk around
- **15-min breaks:** Extended rest - prepare for next activity, snack, fresh air
- **40-min lunch:** Full disconnect - no work thoughts, proper meal, relax
- Use breaks to physically move and look away from screens
- Don't skip breaks - they improve productivity, not reduce it

### Flexibility Options
- **Adjust start time:** Based on your sleep schedule (shift everything proportionally)
- **Swap activities:** LeetCode ↔ New Technology if feeling more/less analytical
- **Split forest walk:** Two 30-min walks (before/after lunch) instead of one 1-hour walk
- **Weekend grocery:** Move shopping to weekend, freeing up 1 hour for extra project time
- **Dev session variations:** Split 3-hour differently (1h + 2h or 45min + 90min + 45min)
- **Early finish option:** Skip guitar to end at 20:15 instead of 21:15 for earlier dinner

### Productivity Strategies
- **Pomodoro within blocks:** Use 25-min focused work + 5-min micro-breaks during longer sessions
- **Phone on silent:** During learning and deep work blocks
- **Timers are your friend:** Set alarms for activity transitions
- **One task at a time:** No multitasking during focused blocks
- **Review daily:** Spend 5 min before bed reflecting on what worked

### Weekly Variation
- **LeetCode:** Easy on Mondays, Medium Tue-Thu, Hard on Friday
- **New Technology:** Stick with one tech for the whole week for deeper learning
- **Personal App:** Set weekly sprint goals (features to complete by Sunday)
- **Guitar:** Vary between technique, theory, and song learning each day
- **Shopping:** Can bulk-shop on weekends to free up weekday time

### Integration with Your Resources
- Use your `comprehensive_angular_middle_questions_with_links.md` during Angular theory time
- Apply concepts from `testing-e2e-unit-integration-guide.md` in personal app
- Practice guitar using your `jimi-hendrix-guitar-roadmap.md`
- Reference `comprehensive_advanced_javascript_questions.md` for deeper JS understanding

## Additional Notes

### Schedule Design Philosophy
- **Organized by energy, not input order:** Activities placed when you'll be most effective
- **Strategic breaks:** 2.5+ hours of rest prevents burnout and maintains focus
- **3-hour project split:** Two 90-min deep work sessions > one 3-hour marathon
- **Physical activity midday:** Natural energy reset between mental work blocks

### Not Scheduled (Add as needed)
- **Before 9:00:** Wake up time (aim for 7:30-8:30 to have time to wake up naturally)
- **Meals:** Breakfast at 9:00-9:30, lunch at 14:50-15:30, dinner after 21:15
- **Evening (21:15+):** Dinner, entertainment, social time, hobbies, sleep prep
- **Emergency buffer:** The schedule has flexibility built-in

### Weekend Adjustments
- **Sleep in:** Start at 10:00 or 11:00 instead of 9:00
- **Extended sessions:** 
  - Guitar practice: 2 hours instead of 1
  - Personal project: 5-6 hours with breaks
  - Forest walk: 2 hours hiking/nature
- **Bulk activities:** Do grocery shopping for the whole week
- **Skip or reduce:** Can skip LeetCode or reduce learning blocks for more project time

### Productivity Tracking
- **Daily log:** What you accomplished in each block
- **Energy tracking:** Note when you felt most/least focused
- **Adjustment notes:** What worked, what didn't, what to change tomorrow
- **Weekly review:** Sunday evening - review progress, plan next week
- **Celebrate wins:** Acknowledge completed features, solved problems, learned skills

### Hydration & Nutrition Reminders
- Water during every break (aim for 2L+ per day)
- Light snack every 2-3 hours
- Proper lunch (14:50-15:30) prevents afternoon crash
- Coffee/tea strategic (morning + after lunch, avoid after 17:00 for better sleep)

### Signs to Adjust
- **Consistently tired:** May need earlier bedtime or later start
- **Afternoon slump:** Move walk to after lunch instead of before
- **Skipping breaks:** Schedule is too ambitious, need longer breaks
- **Rushing through tasks:** Allocated time may be insufficient
- **Bored/distracted:** May need to swap order of activities
