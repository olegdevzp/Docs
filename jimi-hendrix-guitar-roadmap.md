### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem: Thumb cramping with thumb-over technique**
- Solution: Reduce tension, practice in short bursts (5 min), gradually build strength

**Problem: Embellishments sound muddy**
- Solution: Slow down, ensure each note rings clearly before adding the next

**Problem: Can't keep time with backing tracks**
- Solution: Practice with metronome first, start slower than target tempo

**Problem: Fingers can't reach for chord embellishments**
- Solution: Stretch exercises before practice, work on finger independence drills

**Problem: Transitions between pentatonic positions feel awkward**
- Solution: Practice just the transition points, use visual markers (dots on fretboard)
